Pwani Course Intro to Stats using R
===============

This site is for the development of a course based on work carried out initially at [KWTRP](http://www.kemri-wellcome.org) to provide an Introduction to Stats and Epi concepts and was modelled on work initially done at LSHTM.

The team involved in doing this includes [@gfegan](mailto:gfegan@kemri-wellcome.or) from KWTRP in Kilifi, [@Roseki](https://github.com/roseki) from Pwani and the overall projects is being led by [Tabitha Mwangi](mailto:t.mwangi@pu.ke.ac) 

Amongst other things the project will take the original Stata(tm) **command  ie .do** files and turn them into [*R*](http://cran.r-project.org) **scripts**.

The project will utilise an [R-Studio](http:/www.rstudio.com) Server [installation](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/server) running on the [Pwani University](http://www.pu.ac.ke) ICT infrastructure

[Ken Mwai](http://www.linkedin.com/in/kennmwai) will be helping out on some of the IT setup for the project as well as maybe some stats teaching in addition
